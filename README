This is a preview of one in many collections of stereograph cards that I have created using Unity. To have a better understanding of the project, you can import this collection into an unity engine and create a new unity build. Credits to Gettysburg College, Minh Nguyen, and Wojtek Just. The collection is property of Gettysburg College.
